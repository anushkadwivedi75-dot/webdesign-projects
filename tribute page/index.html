      <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Born in 1815, Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer. 
        She is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed 
        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
        Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first 
        algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. 
        This has earned her the title of the "first computer programmer."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ada foresaw the potential of computers to go beyond mere number-crunching, 
        envisioning them as tools that could manipulate symbols and even create music.
